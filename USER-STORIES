Title:
Correct Hand Size

Description:
As a human player I want all players to be dealt exactly 11 tiles at the beginning  of
the game so we can play fairly and according to the rules.

Success:
Each player's hand size at the beginning of the game is 11 tiles
Failure:
Any player's hand  is  any other number of tiles
